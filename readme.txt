== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin have a coupon limit? =
This plugin works with an unlimited number of coupons.

= Why isn't my coupon auto-applying? =
The coupon will apply only when conditions are met.  This includes conditions in the WooCommerce coupon settings under Usage Restriction and Usage Limits.  For instance, the coupon expiration date (if set) must be in the future. If a previously auto-applied coupon is manually removed from the cart, it will not auto apply again unless another coupon has been added and removed.

= My cart page name is not '/cart', will the plugin still work? =
Auto Coupons will work with a non-standard cart page name.  Just open or save any coupon for the change to take effect.

= How can I troubleshoot my coupons? =
To troubleshoot, you must be logged in as an administrator.  Visit the cart page and press the 'Auto Coupons Status' button to list all coupons with status.
